# 📦 Memory Card: Scrum Artifacts

## 🎯 The 3 Artifacts - Quick Summary

### 📋 1. Product Backlog

**Definition:** Ordered list of everything needed for the product

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Owner** | Product Owner only |
| **Order** | By priority/value |
| **Nature** | Dynamic, emergent, constantly changing |

| **Bottom Items** | Unclear, large, need detailing |

**🔑 Key Points:**
- ✅ Single source of work
- ✅ One person owns it (Product Owner)
- ✅ New tasks added after each Sprint
- ✅ Needs continuous refinement

---

### 📝 2. Sprint Backlog

- ✅ Negotiable while maintaining goal

---

### 📦 3. Increment

**Definition:** Usable result from Sprint

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Owner** | Entire Scrum Team |
| **Basic Condition** | Meets Definition of Done (DoD) |

## 🎓 Quick Memorization

### 📊 DoD vs DoR

| | Definition of Ready (DoR) | Definition of Done (DoD) |
|---|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **When?** | Before starting work | After completing work |
| **Why?** | Is task clear? | Is work complete? |
| **Who?** | Product Owner + Team | Entire team |

### 🔄 Artifact Cycle

## 🌟 Other Agile Methodologies - Summary

### 🏭 Lean

**Principle:** Minimize Waste

**7 Types of Waste - TIMWOOD:**
- **T**ransportation
- **I**nventory
- **M**otion
- **W**aiting
- **O**verproduction
- **O**ver-processing
- **D**efects

### 🔄 Kaizen

**Meaning:** Change for the better

**PDCA Cycle:**
```
Plan → Do → Check → Act → Plan...
```

**Principle:** Continuous gradual improvement

---

### 📊 Kanban

**Meaning:** Visual card

**Principle:** Visualize workflow

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────┐

└─────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**WIP Limit:** Work In Progress limit (e.g., WIP 5)
