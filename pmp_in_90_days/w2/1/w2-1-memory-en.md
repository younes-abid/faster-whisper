## 🔄 Core Concepts

### **Iterative**:
```
Design → Feedback → Improve → Design → Feedback
```
- **Improve** same feature multiple times
- **Goal**: Reach perfection
- **Example**: Improve login interface

### **Incremental**:
```
Feature A → Feature B → Feature C → Feature D
```
- **Add** new feature
- **Gradually** each time
- **Example**: Add login methods (Username → Facebook → Google)

### **Agile** = Iterative + Incremental together

## 🔑 Key Concepts - For Exam

### **Value**:
```
Anything useful to user/customer
```

- Worse: Fail at month 6 (loss $60K)

### **Frequent Delivery**:
```
Ideal: Every 2-4 weeks
```
- Can be one week
- Most important: **Consistency** (Consistent Cadence)

### **Working Software**:
```
Primary measure of progress
```
- Not documentation
- Not meetings
- Usable product
