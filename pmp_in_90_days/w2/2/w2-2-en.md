# Week 2 - Session 2: Scrum Framework

## Overview
This session explains in detail the **Scrum Framework**, the most popular and widely used Agile framework in the world. Scrum is a structured framework for implementing Agile principles in projects.

---

## 🏈 Origin of the Name "Scrum"

### Where does the word come from?
**Scrum** is taken from **American Football**

**The Concept**:
```
Team moves from line to line
    ↓
Small goal → Small goal → Small goal
    ↓
Until they reach the final goal
```

**Meaning**:
- Not just running directly to the final goal
- But advancing **step by step**
- Achieving successive small goals
- Until reaching the big goal

---

## 🔄 The Time-Box - Sprint

### What is a Sprint?
**Sprint** = The time-box in Scrum

**Naming**:
- Sprint = Fast running for 100 meters
- Sprinting = Fast running
- Sprint is the **beating heart** of Scrum

**Duration**:
- Maximum: **One month** (4 weeks)
- Ideal: **Two weeks - 4 weeks**
- Possible: One week (but rare)

**Golden Rule**: No gaps between sprints!

```
Sprint 1 → Sprint 2 → Sprint 3 → Sprint 4
   ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓
  No gap    No gap    No gap
```

## 🏗️ Scrum Framework Structure

Scrum consists of:
1. **3 Main Pillars** (3 Pillars)
2. **5 Core Values** (5 Values)
3. **3 Roles** (3 Roles)
4. **5 Events** (5 Events)
5. **3 Artifacts** (3 Artifacts)

---

## 🎯 The Three Pillars

### 1️⃣ Transparency:

**Definition**: Complete clarity and disclosure about everything

**Example**:
```
🚗 Driving at night:
- With lights (Transparency) ✅
  → See the road clearly
  → Avoid potholes
  → Arrive safely

- Without lights (No Transparency) ❌
  → Can't see the road
  → Might fall in pothole
  → Great danger
```

**In Scrum**:
- All information is clear to everyone
- No secrets among team members
- Problems appear immediately

---

### 2️⃣ Inspection:

**Definition**: Regularly examining work and progress

**Example**:
```
Before driving:
- Check the road ✅
- Any potholes?
- Does the road go right or left?
- Any danger?
```

**In Scrum**:
- Inspect product continuously
- Inspect progress daily
- Discover problems early

---

### 3️⃣ Adaptation:

**Definition**: Modification and change based on inspection

**Example**:
```
While driving:
- Found road goes right ✅
- Adjusted your direction
- Avoided danger
```

**In Scrum**:
- Modify based on feedback
- Change plan when needed
- Continuous improvement

---

### 🔗 Relationship Between Pillars:

```
Transparency → Inspection → Adaptation
     ↓             ↓             ↓
  See everything → Inspect → Adjust

Without transparency → Can't inspect
Without inspection → Can't adapt
Without adaptation → No improvement
```

---

## 💎 The Five Scrum Values

### 1️⃣ Commitment:

**Meaning**: Commitment to team goal and project

**Example**:
- ❌ "Not my problem, that's someone else's work"
- ✅ "This is our shared goal, I'll help"

---

### 2️⃣ Focus:

**Meaning**: Focus on Sprint Goal

**Real Story**:
```
Programmer had 50+ tabs open in browser!
    ↓
YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc...
    ↓
Result: No focus ❌
    ↓
Solution: Close everything unnecessary ✅
```

**Lesson**: Focus only on current work

---

### 3️⃣ Openness:

**Meaning**: Honesty and frankness with team

**Example**:
- ✅ "There's a problem in the code"
- ✅ "I need help"
- ✅ "I won't be able to finish on time"

---

### 4️⃣ Respect:

**Meaning**: Respecting team members and their work

**Example**:
- ✅ Appreciating others' efforts
- ✅ Listening to everyone's opinions
- ✅ Not belittling anyone

---

### 5️⃣ Courage:

**Meaning**: Bravery to tell the truth

**Real Story**:
```
Instructor noticed colleague opening 50 tabs
    ↓
Had courage and respect
    ↓
Told him politely about the problem
    ↓
Colleague accepted feedback constructively ✅
```

**Lesson**: Tell truth even if difficult

---

### ⚠️ Importance of Five Values:

```
Without any of the five values:
    ↓
Team doesn't work properly ❌
    ↓
Final result negatively affected
```

**Example**:
- Without courage → No one reports problems
- Without respect → Team collapses
- Without focus → No achievement
- Without commitment → Continuous delay
- Without openness → Secrets and hidden problems

---

## 👥 The Three Scrum Roles

### Team Size:
- **10 people or less**
- Small team = Dynamic
- Easy communication
- Faster decisions

**Why small?**
```
Number of people ↑ = Number of communication channels ↑
    ↓
Coordination difficulty ↑
    ↓
Slow response ❌
```

---

### The Three Roles:

```
Scrum Team
    ├── Product Owner
    ├── Scrum Master
    └── Developers
```

---

### 1️⃣ Product Owner:

**Definition**: Person responsible for **Product Value**

**Main Responsibilities**:

#### a) Develop and communicate Product Goal:
- What is the product's final goal?
- What value added for users?

#### b) Manage Product Backlog:
- Create task list
- Order tasks by priority
- **Prioritization**

**Prioritization Example**:
```
Product Backlog:
1. Feature A (Highest priority) ⭐⭐⭐
2. Feature B
3. Feature C
4. Feature D (Lowest priority)
```

#### c) Ensure transparency and clarity:
- Tasks are clear and understood
- Everyone knows what's required
- Appropriate language for team (Arabic, English, Malay, etc.)

**⚠️ Important Notes**:
1. **Only one person** (not committee)
2. Can delegate work but responsibility is his
3. Final decisions are his
4. Organization must respect his decisions

---

### 2️⃣ Scrum Master:

**Definition**: **Servant Leader** for the team

**Goal**: Help team apply Scrum correctly

**Responsibilities**:

#### a) Serving the Team:
- Remove impediments
- Clarify Scrum to everyone

```

#### b) Serving Product Owner:
- Help with Backlog prioritization
- Clarify ideas
- Meet with stakeholders

#### c) Serving Organization:
- Explain Scrum to organization
- How Scrum adds value

---

### 3️⃣ Developers:

**Definition**: People who **get work done**

**Who are they?**
- **Anyone who adds value to product**:
  - Programmers
  - Designers

  - Business Analysts
  - Content Writers

**Characteristics**:

#### a) Cross-Functional:
```
One developer can:
- Program ✅
- Design a little ✅
- Test ✅
- Write documentation ✅
```

**Benefit**: If someone absent, others continue

#### b) Self-Organizing:
- **Team** decides how to work
- **Not** the manager
- **No** hierarchical authority

**Example**:
```
❌ Wrong: Manager says "do this"
✅ Correct: Team decides "we'll do this"
```

#### c) Collective Accountability:
- Success = whole team success ✅
- Failure = whole team failure ❌
- Not "someone's fault"
- But "we as team made mistake"

---

### 🚫 No Sub-teams:

```
❌ Wrong:
Frontend Team
Backend Team
Design Team
Testing Team

✅ Correct:
One Scrum Team
(All members together)
```

**Concept**:
- No hierarchy in Scrum
- Everyone at same level
- Scrum Master ≠ boss
- Product Owner ≠ boss
- Developers ≠ subordinates
- **Everyone equal** ✅

---

## 🎪 The Five Scrum Events

### Basic Structure:

```
🎯 Sprint (Big container)
    ├── 1. Sprint Planning
    ├── 2. Daily Scrum
    ├── 3. Sprint Review
    └── 4. Sprint Retrospective
    
5. Product Increment (Continuous delivery)
```

**Rule**: Everything happens **inside the Sprint**

---

### 🔄 Sprint - The Container Event

#### Characteristics:
- **Duration**: Month or less (1-4 weeks)
- **No gaps**: Sprint → Sprint → Sprint
- **All work** happens inside it

#### Golden Rules:

##### 1. No changes affecting goal:
```
✅ Can: Improve tasks
✅ Can: Add details
❌ Cannot: Change goal itself
```

##### 2. No quality reduction:
```
Quality = Always constant ✅
Speed ≠ Excuse to reduce quality ❌
```

##### 3. Refine Backlog when needed:
```
Clear tasks → Top of Backlog
Unclear tasks → Bottom of Backlog
    ↓
During Sprint: Can clarify unclear tasks ✅
```

##### 4. Re-negotiation:
```
Discovered: New necessary task
    ↓
Product Owner + Team negotiate
    ↓
Add it? Or postpone?
```

#### Sprint Cancellation:

**When canceled?**
- **Only** if goal becomes **completely worthless**

**Example**:
```
Scenario:
- Goal: Build app to track citizen movements (Lockdown)
- During Sprint: Government cancels lockdown completely
- Result: Goal no longer meaningful ❌
- Decision: Cancel Sprint ✅
```

**Who decides?**
- **Only Product Owner**

**⚠️ Important Note**:
```
Sprint Cancellation ≠ Failure to achieve goal

❌ Wrong: "Won't achieve goal, let's cancel Sprint"
✅ Correct: "Work until end, learn from mistakes"
```

---

### 1️⃣ Sprint Planning

#### Goal:
Determine **what** to do and **how** to do it

#### Duration:
- **8 hours** maximum (for month-long Sprint)
- Shorter for shorter Sprint

#### Three Main Questions:

```
Sprint Goal:
"Why is this work important?"
"What value added to stakeholders?"
```

**Must answer before meeting ends!**

##### 2. What can be done? (What)
```
From Product Backlog → Select tasks
    ↓
Add to Sprint Backlog
```

**Process**:
- Product Owner presents priority tasks
- Team discusses
- Team chooses what they can accomplish

**⚠️ Difficulty of Estimation**:
```
"How many tasks can we accomplish?"
    ↓
Difficult question initially ❌
    ↓
Becomes easier with time ✅
```

**Why becomes easier?**
- Team gets to know each other
- Better product understanding
- Accumulated experience
- Know velocity

##### 3. How will work be done? (How)
```
Team plans:
- How to convert tasks → Increment
- Break tasks into smaller tasks
- Each task = day or less
```

**⚠️ Who decides How?**
- **Team only** ✅
- **Not** Product Owner ❌
- **Not** Scrum Master ❌
- **Not** Manager ❌

**Concept**:
```
❌ Wrong: Manager says "do X then Y then Z"
✅ Correct: Team decides "we'll do A then B then C"
```

#### Outputs:

##### a) Sprint Goal:
```
Example:
"Enable user to login
through social media"
```
