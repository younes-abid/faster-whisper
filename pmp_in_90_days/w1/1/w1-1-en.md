> **Note**: This program will focus heavily on Processes

## 📈 Project Success and Failure Statistics

### The Chaos Report by Standish Group

This report is one of the most important studies examining project success and failure rates globally:

#### Historical Results:
- Initially: Only **20%** of projects were successful
- Challenged projects: A large percentage exceeded planned cost and time

#### Current State (2020):
- **Current success rate**: 33%
- Results include successful projects, challenged projects, and failed projects
- Challenged projects: Complete but with higher costs (sometimes double) and longer timeframes

#### Relationship Between Project Size and Success:
- **Small projects**: 43% success rate
- **Medium projects**: 50% success rate
- **Large projects**: 25% success rate

> **Key Insight**: The larger the project, the higher the probability of failure. Solution: Break large projects into smaller ones.

## 🎯 Project Success Criteria

### The Traditional Three Criteria:

1. **Scope**
   - Completing all agreed-upon project requirements
   - Deliverables and outputs

2. **Time/Schedule**
   - Completing the project within the specified timeline

3. **Cost**
   - Staying within the allocated budget

### The Fourth Modern Criterion:

4. **Value/Benefits**
   - Achieving the intended benefits of the project
   - It's not enough to complete the project within scope, time, and cost only
   - Example: Building a children's hospital in an area with low child population = failure to deliver value

> **Modern Definition**: A successful project achieves its objectives within scope, time, and cost **AND delivers the intended value**

## ⚠️ Reasons for Project Failure

### The Pareto Rule (80/20 Rule)
When analyzing problems, focus on the top 2-3 causes (20% of causes create 80% of problems) rather than scattering efforts across all causes.

### Four Main Reasons for Project Failure:

#### 1. Poor Planning
- Lack of good, solid planning
- Planning is the foundation of any successful project

#### 2. Poor Coordination
- Lack of coordination between different departments
- **Illustrative Example** (exaggerated for clarity):
  - Client requests a luxury car with high specifications
  - Finance department allocates a limited budget
  - Production department produces a bicycle (instead of a car)
  - Design department creates a sailboat design
  - Result: Each department works independently without coordination

#### 3. Lack of Qualified Project Manager
- Absence of a project manager who is:
  - Trained and qualified
  - Has practical experience
  - Possesses management and leadership skills
  - Capable of coordinating between all departments

#### 4. Lack of Senior Management Support
- Absence of follow-up and support from senior management
- No oversight of inter-departmental coordination
- Project manager's role in:
  - Continuous engagement
  - Communication management
  - Stakeholder management

## 📖 Essential Definitions

### What is a Project?

**Definition**: A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.

#### Project Characteristics:

1. **Temporary**
   - Has a defined beginning and end
   - Not ongoing work

2. **Unique**
   - Never repeats with the same characteristics
   - Even for the same type of project, circumstances differ
   - Example: Building a villa in one location differs from building the same villa elsewhere (location, workers, conditions...)

3. **Deliverables**:
   - **Product**: Such as a factory, hospital, iPhone
   - **Service**: Such as training, digital transformation, tourism service
   - **Result**: Such as research, master's/doctoral thesis

### What is Project Management?

**Definition**: The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements and objectives.

#### Key Elements:
- Knowledge
- Skills
- Tools
- Techniques

**Objective**: Achieve project requirements and objectives while meeting client expectations.

## 🔄 Difference Between Projects and Operations

### Project:
- Temporary (has a beginning and end)
- Unique (doesn't repeat identically)
- Example: Building a factory (two years of work, constructing facilities, installing equipment)

### Operations:
- Ongoing (no defined end)
- Repetitive (same work daily)
- Example: Operating the factory after construction (continuous daily production)

> **Relationship**: The project ends, then operations begin

## 📚 Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide)

### What is PMBOK?

**PMBOK** = Project Management Body of Knowledge

- A guide published by the Project Management Institute (PMI)
- Contains global best practices in project management

### How is PMBOK Developed?

1. **Specialized Committees**:
   - Composed of globally successful project managers
   - From various industries and countries

2. **Research on Best Practices**:
   - Study successful projects
   - Analyze tools and techniques used
   - Document best practices

3. **Continuous Updates**:
   - New edition approximately every 4 years
   - Editions: Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth coming soon

### Why So Many Tools?

- **Small and Medium Projects**: May need only 2-3 tools
- **Large Projects**: Require multiple advanced tools and techniques

Example for risk identification:
- Small project: SWOT analysis and brainstorming sufficient
- Large project: Needs 6+ tools for comprehensive analysis
