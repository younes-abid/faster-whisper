# Week 1 - Session 8: Inputs, Tools & Techniques, Outputs (ITTO) and Organizational Process Assets

## Overview
This session covers one of the most important concepts in project management: **ITTO** - which stands for **Inputs, Tools & Techniques, and Outputs**. The session also explains **Organizational Process Assets (OPA)** and **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)**.

---

## 🔑 Basic Concept: ITTO

### What is ITTO?

**ITTO** = **I**nputs + **T**ools & **T**echniques + **O**utputs

**Definition**:
- Every **Management Process** has:
  1. **Inputs**
  2. **Tools & Techniques**
  3. **Outputs**

---

## 📊 Management Process - General Model

```

Outputs
```

**Golden Rule**:
> To get **valid outputs**, you must have **correct inputs** and apply appropriate **tools & techniques**.

---

## 🎯 Practical Example: Teacher Evaluation

Let's understand ITTO with a real-life example:

### Scenario:
**Required**: Evaluate a teacher to decide on promotion

---

### 1. Outputs - What do we want?

**Required Output**: 
- **Promotion Decision**

**Question**: Will this teacher be promoted or not?

---

### 2. Inputs - What do we need?

To make promotion decision, we need:

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Attendance Record** | Presence and absence |
| **Student List** | Class roster |
| **Student Grades** | Academic performance |
| **Student Performance** | Overall level |
| **Interaction Record** | With colleagues |
| **Student Evaluation** | Teacher feedback from students |
| **Training Courses** | Professional development |
| **General Behavior** | Overall conduct |

**All these are Inputs**

---

### 3. Tools & Techniques

After gathering inputs, how do we evaluate?

#### Tools Used:

1. **Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
   - If performance is X → Outstanding
   - If performance is Y → Good
   - If performance is Z → Acceptable

2. **Meetings**
   - Meeting with principal to discuss inputs

3. **Expert Judgment**
   - Consult educational supervisor
   - Consult evaluation expert

4. **Discussion Sessions**
   - Gather opinions

---

### 4. Final Result:

```
Inputs → Tools & Techniques → Outputs
(Data) → (Evaluation & Analysis) → (Promotion Decision)
```

**Promotion Decision** = Output
- Promotion amount
- Bonus value
- Salary increase

## 🏢 Organizational Process Assets (OPA)

### Definition:

**OPA** = Everything the organization has:
- **Documents**
- **Policies**
- **Procedures**
- **Past plans**
- **Lessons learned**
- **Templates**

---

### Importance of OPA:

✅ **Saves time**: Don't start from scratch

✅ **Improves performance**: Apply best practices

---

### Types of OPA:

#### 1. Processes & Procedures:

- **Policies**
- **Procedures**
- **Templates**
- **Guidelines**

**Example**:
- Template for project charter
- Template for risk plan
- Procurement approval procedures

---

#### 2. Corporate Knowledge Base:

- **Lessons Learned**
- **Historical Information**
- **Vendor Database**
- **Resource Database**
- **Past Risk Registers**

---

### Important Question: When do we use OPA?

**Answer**: In **almost every** management process!

**Example**:
- When estimating costs → refer to past project costs
- When identifying risks → refer to past project risks
- When writing project charter → use organization template

---

## 🌍 Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)

### Definition:

**EEF** = Internal and external factors that affect the project

---

### Types of EEF:

#### 1. Internal EEF:

| Factor | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Organizational Culture** | Cooperation, transparency, openness | Affects communication and motivation |
| **Organizational Structure** | Functional, matrix, projectized | Affects manager authority |
| **Infrastructure** | Offices, equipment, devices | Affects productivity |
| **Available Software** | Project management tools | Affects efficiency |
| **Resource Availability** | Available staff, budgets | Affects execution capability |
| **Staff Capabilities** | Experience, skills | Affects work quality |

---

#### 2. External EEF:

| Factor | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Market Conditions** | Supply and demand, competition | Material prices, supplier availability |
| **Social & Cultural Influences** | Customs, traditions, language | Celebrations, motivation styles |
| **Legal Restrictions** | Laws, regulations | Building codes, labor laws |
| **Standards** | Quality standards, industry standards | Saudi Code, ISO |
| **Environmental Considerations** | Climate, weather | Storms, snow, heat |
| **Political Climate** | Stability, government policies | Import restrictions |

---

### Practical Examples of EEF Impact:

#### Example 1: Climate

**Scenario**: Construction project in France

**EEF**: 
- Expect snowstorms in winter
- Low temperatures

**Impact on Project**:
- Must make deeper foundations (frost protection)
- Add contingency time for storms
- Additional costs for heating and protection

**Comparison**: Same project in Saudi Arabia
- No need for snow protection
- But need heat protection
- Stop work during extreme heat

---

#### Example 2: Culture

**Scenario**: Motivating project team

**In Arab World**:
- Upon achieving major milestone
- Celebrate with party, sheep slaughter, food
- Part of culture

**In Another Country**:
- Motivation might be different
- Perhaps certificate of appreciation
- Perhaps only monetary bonus

**Lesson**: Respect local culture

---

#### Example 3: Laws & Standards

**Scenario**: Construction project

**In Saudi Arabia**:
- Must follow **Saudi Building Code**

**In Oman**:
- Must follow **Omani Code**

**In Europe**:
- Must follow **Eurocodes**

**Impact**:
- Different design
- Different materials
- Different costs

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### Definition:

**Lessons Learned** = Knowledge gained from project experience

---

### When do we write Lessons Learned?

**Important Answer**: 
✅ **Throughout the Project**
❌ Not only at the end

---

### Scenario:

**Common Mistake**:
- Some think lessons learned are written **only** at project end

**Correct**:
- Lessons learned are written **throughout the project**
- Whenever something important happens → record it
- At end of each phase → review and add
- At project end → compile all lessons

---

### How to Write Lessons Learned?

#### We need:

1. **Template** - from OPA
   - Unified structure for writing lessons

2. **Formal Process**
   - Periodic meetings
   - Review sessions

3. **Database**
   - To store lessons
   - For easy access later

---

### Examples of Lessons Learned:

| Situation | Lesson Learned |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Supplier delay** | Add penalty clause in future contracts |
| **Cost increase** | Improve estimation method, add larger contingency |
| **Communication problem** | Use better communication tools |
| **Team conflict** | Set clear rules from beginning |
| **Scope change** | Apply change management process strictly |

---

## 🔄 Relationship Between OPA, EEF, and Inputs

### In every management process:

```
Inputs include:
  ├── Project documents
  ├── Project plans
  ├── OPA (Organizational Process Assets)
  └── EEF (Enterprise Environmental Factors)
```

**Important Note**:
- **OPA** and **EEF** appear as **inputs** in most management processes

---

## 🎓 Starting a New Project - How to Benefit?

### Scenario:

**You**: New project manager
**Situation**: Organization executed similar project years ago

**Question**: What's the first action you should take?

---

### Answer:

✅ **Go back to Organizational Process Assets** (OPA)

**Search for**:
- Past project plans
- Cost estimates
- Market studies
- Supplier list
- Past agreements
- Material quantities used
- Problems that occurred
- **Lessons learned**

---

### Benefit:

1. **Save time**: Don't start from scratch
2. **Avoid mistakes**: Learn from past errors
3. **More accurate estimates**: Based on real data
4. **Better decisions**: Based on past experience

---

### Warning:

❌ **Don't copy blindly**
- Prices changed
- Market changed
- Conditions changed
- Technology evolved

✅ **Use as reference and modify**
- Update prices
- Review availability
- Verify suitability

---

## 🎯 For Exam: Confusing Points

### Common Question:

**When are Lessons Learned written?**

**Options**:
- A) At project start
- B) At project end
- C) Throughout the project
- D) Only when problems occur

**Correct Answer**: **C) Throughout the project**

---

### Another Question:

**You need to write lessons learned. Which OPA do you need?**

**Options**:
- A) Lessons Learned Template
- B) Historical Lessons Learned

**Problem**: Both answers can be correct!

**Distinction**:
- If question: "to write new lesson" → **A** (template)
- If question: "to benefit from old lessons" → **B** (historical)
