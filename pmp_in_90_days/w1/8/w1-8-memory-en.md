# Memory Card: ITTO & Organizational Process Assets

## 🔑 ITTO - Basic Formula

```
ITTO = Inputs + Tools & Techniques + Outputs
```

**Every management process** = I + T&T + O

---

## 📊 Golden Rule

```
Correct Inputs + Right Tools = Valid Outputs
```

---

## 🏢 OPA - Organizational Process Assets

### Quick Definition:
**OPA** = What the organization has

### Two Types:

#### 1. Processes:
- **Policies**
- **Procedures**
- **Templates**

#### 2. Knowledge:
- **Lessons Learned**
- **Historical Data**
- **Databases**

---

## 🌍 EEF - Enterprise Environmental Factors

### Quick Definition:
**EEF** = What surrounds the project

### Two Types:

#### 1. Internal:
- Organizational culture
- Organizational structure
- Infrastructure
- Software
- Resource availability

#### 2. External:
- Market conditions
- Social culture
- Laws
- Standards
- Climate

---

## 🎯 For Exam - Critical Points

### When are Lessons Learned written?
✅ **Throughout the project**
❌ Not only at the end

### What's the difference between OPA & EEF?
- **OPA** = What organization has (internal)
- **EEF** = What affects project (internal + external)

### Where do OPA & EEF appear?
✅ As **Inputs** in most processes

---

## 📝 Quick Example: Teacher Evaluation

### Required Output:
**Promotion Decision**

### Inputs:
- Attendance record
- Student grades
- Evaluations
- Training courses

### Tools:
- KPIs
- Meetings
- Expert judgment

### Result:
**Promotion decision + bonus**

## 🔄 Relationship Between Concepts

```
Every Management Process:
  ├── Inputs
  │   ├── Documents
  │   ├── Plans
  │   ├── OPA ← from organization
  │   └── EEF ← from environment
  ├── Tools & Techniques
  │   ├── Meetings
  │   ├── Expert judgment
  │   └── Software
  └── Outputs
      ├── Schedules
      ├── Budgets

## 💡 Starting New Project

### Question:
New project similar to old one. First action?

### Answer:
✅ **Go back to OPA**

### Search for:
- Past plans
- Past costs
- Supplier lists
- **Lessons learned**

### Warning:
❌ Don't copy blindly
✅ Update and modify

---

## 🎲 Examples of EEF Impact

### 1. Climate:
- **France**: Snow → deeper foundations
- **Saudi Arabia**: Heat → sun protection

### 2. Culture:
- **Arab**: Celebration = sheep slaughter
- **Western**: Celebration = certificate

### 3. Laws:
- **Saudi Arabia**: Saudi Code
- **Oman**: Omani Code
- **Europe**: Eurocodes

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### When?
**Throughout the project** - not only at end

### How?
1. Use **template** (from OPA)
2. Record continuously
3. Compile at end

### Examples:
| Problem | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| Supplier delay | Penalty clause in contract |
| Cost increase | Larger contingency |
| Team conflict | Clear rules upfront |

---

## 🎯 For Exam - Confusing Questions

### Question 1:
**To write lessons learned, which OPA do you need?**

**Two correct options**:
- A) Lessons template (to write new)
- B) Historical lessons (to benefit from old)

**Distinction**: Read question carefully!

---

### Question 2:
**In which phase are lessons written?**

✅ **Throughout the project**
❌ Not: start, end, or only during problems

---

## 🔑 Quick Memorization

### ITTO:
```
I = Inputs
T&T = Tools & Techniques
O = Outputs
```

### OPA:
```
Organizational Process Assets
= Processes (templates) + Knowledge (lessons)
```

### EEF:
```
Enterprise Environmental Factors
= Internal (culture) + External (market)
```

## ⚡ Quick Points

1. **49 processes** → each has ITTO
2. **OPA** = from organization
3. **EEF** = from environment
4. **Lessons Learned** = throughout project
5. **OPA + EEF** = inputs in most processes
6. **Valid outputs** ← correct inputs
7. **New project** → go to OPA
8. **Respect local culture**
9. **Consider climate** in planning
10. **Follow local laws**

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ Lessons only at end
✅ Lessons throughout project

❌ OPA = EEF
✅ OPA ≠ EEF (different)

❌ EEF all external
✅ EEF = internal + external

❌ Copy from OPA as-is
✅ Use as reference and update
