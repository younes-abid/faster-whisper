# Memory Card: Review - Organizational Structures & Exam

## 🎯 Golden Rule for Exam

```
If question doesn't specify structure type
↓
Assume: Strong Matrix
```

---

## 📊 Five Structures - Quick

```
Functional → Weak → Balanced → Strong → Projectized
  0-25%      25-40%    40-60%     60-85%    85-100%
```

---

## 🔤 Terms - Memorize!

### Hierarchy (Lowest to Highest):

```
Project Expeditor
    ↓ (lowest authority)
Project Coordinator
    ↓ (limited authority)
Project Manager
    ↓ (real authority)
```

---

## ⚠️ Watch for Misleading Terms!

| Term | Valid? | Note |
|------|--------|------|
| **Project Manager** | ✅ | Project manager |
| **Project Coordinator** | ✅ | Coordinator (low authority) |
| **Project Expeditor** | ✅ | Expeditor (lowest authority) |
| **Functional Manager** | ✅ | Department manager |
| **Package Manager** | ❌ | Software term only! |

---

## 📝 Exam Question Pattern

### Structure:

- **4 options** (A, B, C, D)
- **2 clearly wrong**
- **1 close** but not best
- **1 best** ← Choose this!

---

## 🎯 Reporting

| Structure | Reports To |
|-----------|-----------|
| Functional | Functional Mgr |
| Weak Matrix | Functional Mgr |
| **Balanced Matrix** | **Both** ✓ |
| Strong Matrix | PM |
| Projectized | PM |

---

## 💡 Solution Strategy

### 3 Steps:

1. **Did question specify structure?**
   - Yes → Answer based on it
   - No → Assume Strong Matrix

2. **Eliminate 2 wrong answers**
   - Usually obvious

3. **Choose best from remaining**
   - Best fit for context

---

## 🔑 Authority - Quick

| Structure | PM Authority | Budget Control |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Functional | 0-25% | Functional Mgr |
| Weak | 25-40% | Functional Mgr |
| Balanced | 40-60% | Shared |
| **Strong** | **60-85%** | **PM** ✓ |
| Projectized | 85-100% | PM |

---

## 📋 Role Terminology

### Functional Manager:
- Department manager (HR, IT, Finance...)
- Role varies by structure

### Project Coordinator:
- **Less than** Project Manager
- Role: **coordination only**
- In: Functional/Weak Matrix

### Project Expeditor:
- **Less than** Coordinator
- Role: **expedite/follow-up**
- In: Functional/Weak Matrix

---

## ⚡ Quick Tips

1. **Coordinator** = low authority
2. **Expeditor** = lower than Coordinator
3. **Package Manager** = NOT related!
4. **Strong Matrix** = default assumption
5. **Both** = Balanced Matrix

---

## 🧠 Quick Scenarios

### Scenario 1:
**"Functional manager refused to provide staff"**
→ PM has low authority
→ Functional or Weak Matrix

### Scenario 2:
**"PM decided to increase budget independently"**
→ PM has high authority
→ Strong Matrix or Projectized

### Scenario 3:
**"Staff reports to two managers"**
→ Balanced Matrix

---

## 🎓 Sample Question

**Question**:
"In Functional structure, what is PM's role?"

**Options**:
- A) Full authority ← clearly wrong
- B) Limited authority, acts as coordinator ← ✅ correct
- C) Equal with Functional Manager ← close but wrong
- D) No role ← clearly wrong

**Answer**: **B**

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ Package Manager = Project Manager
✅ Package Manager = software term

❌ Always assume Functional
✅ Assume **Strong Matrix**

❌ Coordinator = Manager
✅ Coordinator **<** Manager

---

## 🔢 Important Numbers

| Structure | PM Authority |
|-----------|-------------|
| Functional | 0-25% |
| Weak Matrix | 25-40% |
| Balanced Matrix | 40-60% |
| **Strong Matrix** | **60-85%** |
| Projectized | 85-100% |

---

## 💪 Before the Exam

1. ✅ Remember: **Strong Matrix = default**
2. ✅ Know: **Coordinator < Manager**
3. ✅ Watch: **Package Manager = NOT related**
4. ✅ Read question **twice**
5. ✅ Eliminate wrong first
