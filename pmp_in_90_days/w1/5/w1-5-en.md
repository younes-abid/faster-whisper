## 🏛️ Organizational Structures Review

### The Five Types:

```
1. Functional
2. Weak Matrix
3. Balanced Matrix
4. Strong Matrix
5. Projectized
```

---

## 🎯 Critical Point: What Does the Exam Assume?

### ⚠️ Very Important Question:

**"If the question doesn't specify the organizational structure type, what should you assume?"**

### The Answer:

When the exam asks:
- "You are a Project Manager..."
- **Without specifying** the organizational structure type

**Always assume**: You work in **Strong Matrix**

---

## 💡 Why Strong Matrix?

### Explanation:

In **Strong Matrix**:
- ✅ Project Manager has **high authority**
- ✅ Functional Manager **exists** but with limited authority
- ✅ This is the **default assumption** in **most exam questions**
- ✅ Unless the question **explicitly states** another structure type

### Example:

**If the question says**:
"You are a Project Manager working in a company with a Weak Matrix structure..."

→ Here it **specifies** the structure, so answer based on **Weak Matrix**

**If the question says**:
"You are a Project Manager at company X..."

→ Doesn't specify the structure, assume **Strong Matrix**

---

## 📋 Comparison Table - Review

| Element | Functional | Weak Matrix | Balanced Matrix | Strong Matrix | Projectized |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **PM Authority** | 0-25% | 25-40% | 40-60% | 60-85% | 85-100% |
| **Reports To** | Functional Mgr | Functional Mgr | **Both** | PM | PM |
| **Resource Availability** | Very Low | Low | Medium | High | Full |
| **Budget Control** | Functional Mgr | Functional Mgr | Shared | **PM** | **PM** |
| **PM Role** | Coordinator | Coordinator/Lead | PM | PM | PM |

---

## 🔤 Key Terms

### 1. Project Manager

**Abbreviation**: PM
**Role**: Manage project from start to finish
**Authority**: Varies by organizational structure

---

### 2. Project Coordinator

**Abbreviation**: None
**Role**: **Coordination only** (no real authority)
**Where Found**: Functional or Weak Matrix
**Note**: **Less than** Project Manager

---

### 3. Project Expeditor

**Definition**: Person who helps **expedite** task completion
**Role**: Follow-up and acceleration only (no executive authority)
**Where Found**: Functional or Weak Matrix
**Note**: **Less than** Project Coordinator

**Hierarchy**:
```
Project Expeditor < Project Coordinator < Project Manager
```

---

### 4. Functional Manager

**Definition**: Department manager (HR Manager, IT Manager, Finance Manager...)
**Role**: Manage a specific functional department
**Relationship with Projects**: Varies by organizational structure

**In Functional**: **All authority**
**In Weak Matrix**: **Most authority**
**In Balanced Matrix**: **Shared authority**
**In Strong Matrix**: **Advisory role**
**In Projectized**: **Not present** (or minor administrative role)

---

### 5. Package Manager

⚠️ **Important Warning**:

**Package Manager** = **NOT related to project management!**

- This is a term from software development
- Example: npm (Node Package Manager)
- **May appear as wrong answer** in exam as distractor

---

## 🎓 Exam Question Patterns

### Question Type: Multiple Choice

In PMP exam, most questions are **Multiple Choice Questions**:

#### Options:

- **4 choices** (A, B, C, D)
- **One correct answer** (in most cases)
- **Two clearly wrong answers**
- **One "close" answer** but not the best
- **One best answer** (Most Correct)

---

### Sample Question from Lecture:

#### Question:

**"In a Functional organizational structure, what is the role of the Project Manager?"**

**Options**:

**A)** Full authority over the project and team members

**B)** Limited authority and primarily acts as a coordinator or expeditor

**C)** Equal authority with the Functional Manager

**D)** No role in the project

---

### Analysis:

#### Option A: ❌ Wrong
- Full authority = **Projectized** (not Functional)

#### Option B: ✅ Correct
- In Functional, PM = **coordinator only**
- **Very limited** authority

#### Option C: ⚠️ Close but wrong
- This describes **Balanced Matrix** (not Functional)
- In Functional: Functional Manager has **all** authority

#### Option D: ❌ Clearly wrong
- There's no "no role" - there's always some role

**Correct Answer**: **B**

---

## 🧪 Solution Strategy

### Steps:

1. **Read the question carefully**
   - Did it specify structure type?
   - If not → assume **Strong Matrix**

2. **Eliminate clearly wrong answers**
   - Usually 2 options are clearly wrong

3. **Compare the remaining two answers**
   - One is "close" but not the best
   - One is the **best** (Most Correct)

4. **Choose the best**
   - The answer that fits the context **most**

---

## 📝 Misleading Terms

### Watch for these terms in the exam:

| Term | Valid or Invalid? | Clarification |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| **Project Manager** | ✅ Valid | Official project manager |
| **Project Coordinator** | ✅ Valid | Project coordinator (limited authority) |
| **Project Expeditor** | ✅ Valid | Project expeditor (less authority) |
| **Functional Manager** | ✅ Valid | Functional department manager |
| **Package Manager** | ❌ Not related | Software term (npm, etc.) |
| **Fabricated Term** | ❌ Made up | May be used as distractor |

---

## 🎯 Exam Tips

### 1. Default Assumption:

When structure type not specified → **Strong Matrix**

### 2. Reporting:

- **Functional**: Staff reports to **Functional Manager**
- **Weak Matrix**: Staff reports to **Functional Manager**
- **Balanced Matrix**: Staff reports to **Both**
- **Strong Matrix**: Staff reports to **PM**
- **Projectized**: Staff reports to **PM**

### 3. Authority:

```
Lowest ←――――――――――――――――――――→ Highest

Functional → Weak → Balanced → Strong → Projectized
```

### 4. Terminology:

- **Coordinator** = low authority
- **Expeditor** = lower authority
- **Manager** = real authority

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. ✅ **Default assumption** in exam: Strong Matrix
2. ✅ **Project Coordinator** < **Project Manager**
3. ✅ **Project Expeditor** < **Project Coordinator**
4. ✅ **Package Manager** = NOT related to project management
5. ✅ **Functional Manager** = functional department manager
6. ✅ In exam questions: **2 wrong answers** + **1 close** + **1 best**
7. ✅ Read question **carefully** to determine context
8. ✅ **Eliminate wrong** first, then choose **best**
9. ✅ If question specifies structure → answer based on it
10. ✅ If not specified → assume **Strong Matrix**

---

## 💡 Additional Examples

### Example 1:

**Question**:
"You are a Project Manager in a large company. You need a software engineer for 3 weeks, but the IT department manager refused. What do you do?"

**Analysis**:
- Department manager refused → PM has **limited authority**
- Structure: **Functional** or **Weak Matrix**
- **Cannot be** Strong Matrix (PM would have authority)

**Solution**:
- Negotiate with IT manager
- Request support from senior management
- Look for alternatives

---

### Example 2:

**Question**:
"You are a Project Manager. You decided to increase project budget by 20% and hire 5 new developers. What structure type?"

**Analysis**:
- Decided **independently** to increase budget and hire staff
- **Very high** authority
- Structure: **Projectized** or **Strong Matrix**

---

### Example 3:

**Question**:
"Mohammed works as an accountant in Finance department. He spends 3 days/week with Project A, and 2 days with Project B. Reports to Finance Manager and both PMs. What structure?"

**Analysis**:
- Works on **multiple projects**
- Reports to **multiple managers**
- Structure: **Balanced Matrix**

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes - Avoid!

❌ **Wrong**: Package Manager = Project Manager
✅ **Right**: Package Manager is software term only

❌ **Wrong**: Always assume Functional
✅ **Right**: Assume **Strong Matrix** if not specified

❌ **Wrong**: Coordinator = Manager
✅ **Right**: Coordinator is **less than** Manager

❌ **Wrong**: In Strong Matrix there's no functional manager
✅ **Right**: Exists but in **advisory** role

---

## 📚 Review Tips

### Before the Exam:

1. ✅ Review **comparison table** daily
2. ✅ Memorize **PM authority** in each structure
3. ✅ Remember: **Strong Matrix = default assumption**
4. ✅ Practice **situational questions**
5. ✅ Read questions **twice** before answering
