# Week 1 - Session 4: Organizational Structures

## Overview
This session covers the different types of organizational structures and their impact on project management, focusing on Functional, Projectized, and Matrix organizations.

---

## 🏢 Main Types of Organizational Structures

There are **3 main types** of organizational structures:

1. **Functional Organization**
2. **Projectized Organization**
3. **Matrix Organization**

---

## 📊 1. Functional Organization

### Definition:
Traditional structure where the company is divided into **functional departments** by specialization.

### Structure:

```
CEO
    ├── HR Department
    ├── Finance Department
    ├── IT Department
    ├── Procurement Department
    ├── Marketing Department
    └── Maintenance Department
```

### Characteristics:

✅ **Traditional structure** common in most companies and organizations
✅ Each department works in its **functional specialty**
✅ Each department head is a **Functional Manager**
✅ Employees report to their **department manager**

### Examples:
- Government agencies
- Charities
- Traditional tech companies
- Most public institutions

---

## 🚀 2. Projectized Organization

### Definition:
The **entire company** is organized around **projects** rather than functional departments.

### Structure:

```
CEO
    ├── Project Manager A
    │   ├── Engineers
    │   ├── Accountant
    │   ├── IT Staff
    │   └── HR Staff
    ├── Project Manager B
    │   ├── Engineers
    │   ├── Accountant
    │   ├── IT Staff
    │   └── HR Staff
    └── Project Manager C
        └── ...
```

### Characteristics:

✅ **Entire company** operates on a **project basis**
✅ Each **Project Manager** has a complete team
✅ Staff are **dedicated to projects**
✅ When project ends → Staff move to another project

### When to Use?

Companies providing **project-based services**:
- Construction companies
- Consulting firms
- Large engineering companies
- Software companies (large projects)

### Practical Example:

A construction company with:
- **Tower building project in Riyadh**
- **Hospital building project in Jeddah**
- **Mall building project in Dammam**

Each project has:
- Dedicated Project Manager
- Dedicated engineers
- Dedicated accountant
- Dedicated IT team (if large project)

---

## 🔀 3. Matrix Organization

### Definition:
A **combination** of:
- Functional structure
- Projectized structure

This is the meaning of **Matrix** → **Overlap**

### Matrix Sub-types:

There are **3 sub-types**:

1. **Weak Matrix**
2. **Balanced Matrix**
3. **Strong Matrix**

---

### 3.1 Weak Matrix

#### Characteristics:

- **Very close** to Functional organization
- **Project Manager**: **Very limited authority**
- **Staff**: Report primarily to **Functional Manager**
- **Resources**: Controlled by functional managers

#### Project Manager:

- **Authority**: Little to none
- **Role**: Coordination only (Coordinator)
- May be called: **Project Coordinator** or **Project Leader**
- **No authority** over resources or budget

#### Structure:

```
CEO
    ├── HR Manager ← Highest authority
    │   ├── HR Staff 1
    │   └── HR Staff 2
    ├── IT Manager ← Highest authority
    │   ├── IT Staff 1
    │   └── IT Staff 2
    └── Project Manager ← Limited authority
        (Coordinates only, no real authority)
```

#### Real-World Example:

A traditional company decides to implement an **expansion project**:
- Company is **not used to projects**
- Daily work: accounting, marketing, sales (operations)
- Decides to do a project → Selects **people from departments**:
  - Person from HR
  - Person from Marketing
  - Person from IT
- **Names one**: "Project Manager" (but with limited authority)

**Result**: Project Manager **coordinates only** without real authority

---

### 3.2 Strong Matrix

#### Characteristics:

- **Very close** to Projectized organization
- **Project Manager**: **High authority**
- **Staff**: Report primarily to **Project Manager**
- **Resources**: Controlled by Project Manager

#### Project Manager:

- **Authority**: Very high
- **Controls**:
  - Resources
  - Budget
  - Schedule
- Staff are **dedicated full-time** or mostly to the project

#### Structure:

```
CEO
    ├── Project Manager A ← High authority
    │   ├── IT Staff (reports directly)
    │   ├── Accountant (reports directly)
    │   └── HR Staff (reports directly)
    ├── HR Manager ← Administrative/advisory role
    └── IT Manager ← Administrative/advisory role
```

#### Details:

In large projects:
- Each **Project Manager** has:
  - **Dedicated** IT staff for the project
  - **Dedicated** accountant for the project
  - **Dedicated** HR staff for the project

**Functional Managers** still exist, but:
- Their role is **advisory** or **administrative**
- Staff **work under** Project Manager
- **Real authority** belongs to Project Manager

---

### 3.3 Balanced Matrix

#### Characteristics:

- **Middle ground** between Weak and Strong
- **Project Manager**: **Moderate authority**
- **Resources**: Shared between PM and functional managers
- **Reporting**: Staff may report to both

#### Typical Scenario:

- **Staff** work in their functional departments
- When needed → **Loaned** to projects
- Example: 
  - IT staff works with **Project Manager A** 2 days/week
  - Same staff works with **Project Manager B** 3 days/week

#### Role of PMO:

**Project Management Office (PMO)** acts as **mediator**:

- Takes **calendar/schedule** from each Project Manager
- Knows when each project needs resources
- **Coordinates** resource sharing between projects
- Example:
  - Experienced maintenance staff
  - PMO knows all project schedules
  - Decides: "From date X to Y works with Project A"
  - "From date Y to Z works with Project B"

#### Challenges:

- **Resource conflicts**
- One employee working with multiple PMs
- Requires **precise coordination** from PMO or senior management

## 🎯 Project Manager Authority

### 📉 From Lowest to Highest:

```
Lowest Authority ←―――――――――――――――――――――→ Highest Authority

Functional → Weak Matrix → Balanced Matrix → Strong Matrix → Projectized
```

### Breakdown:

1. **Functional**: Almost no authority (0-25%)
2. **Weak Matrix**: Limited authority (25-40%)
3. **Balanced Matrix**: Moderate authority (40-60%)
4. **Strong Matrix**: High authority (60-85%)
5. **Projectized**: Full authority (85-100%)

## 💡 Exam Tips

### Situational Questions:

The exam will ask situational questions like:

#### Question Type 1: "PM needs resources..."

**Question**: 
"Project Manager needs an engineer for 2 weeks, but the **functional manager refused**. What should the PM do?"

**Analysis**:
- If **functional manager refused** = PM has **limited authority**
- Answer: **Weak Matrix** or **Functional**

---

#### Question Type 2: "PM makes decisions..."

## 📚 Additional Practical Examples

### Example 1: Software Company

**Scenario**:
Large software company with:
- Development department
- Design department
- QA department
- Banking app development project (6 months)

**If Functional**:
- Developers work in Development department
- Project Manager = coordinator only
- Development Manager = real authority

**If Projectized**:
- PM has fully dedicated team
- 5 developers, 2 designers, 2 QA work **only** on this project
- When project ends → move to another project

**If Matrix**:
- Developers work on **multiple projects**
- One developer: 50% on banking project, 50% on another
- Reports to Development Manager **and PM**

---

### Example 2: Hospital

**Scenario**:
Hospital wants to implement **electronic medical records system**

**Current Structure**: Functional (departments: ER, Surgery, Nursing, IT, Admin)

**Implementation Options**:

1. **Weak Matrix**:
   - Assign coordinator from IT
   - Coordinator tries to coordinate with departments
   - But each department has its priorities
   - **Result**: Project delays significantly

2. **Balanced Matrix**:
   - Assign real Project Manager
   - Allocate IT staff part-time
   - PMO coordinates resources
   - **Result**: Good balance

3. **Strong Matrix or Projectized**:
   - Fully dedicated project team
   - Full authority to PM
   - **Result**: Fast execution

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes - Avoid!

❌ **Wrong**: Matrix always means Balanced
✅ **Right**: Matrix has 3 types (Weak, Balanced, Strong)

❌ **Wrong**: Projectized = Matrix
✅ **Right**: Projectized is a **separate** structure different from Matrix

❌ **Wrong**: In Functional there are no projects
✅ **Right**: There can be projects but **PM is weak**

❌ **Wrong**: In Strong Matrix functional departments are eliminated
✅ **Right**: Departments **exist** but have **advisory/administrative** role
