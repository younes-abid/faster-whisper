## 🎓 Question Patterns

### Pattern 1: Functional Manager Refuses
**"Functional manager refused to give engineer to PM"**
→ **Weak Matrix** or **Functional**

### Pattern 2: PM Decides Without Consulting
**"PM decided to increase budget and hire staff"**
→ **Projectized** or **Strong Matrix**

### Pattern 3: Reports to Two
**"Employee reports to both functional manager and PM"**
→ **Balanced Matrix**

### Pattern 4: Coordinator Only
**"PM coordinates only without real authority"**
→ **Functional** or **Weak Matrix**

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes - Avoid!

❌ Matrix = Balanced only
✅ Matrix has **3 types**

❌ Projectized = Strong Matrix
✅ **Completely different**

❌ No projects in Functional
✅ Projects exist but **weak PM**

## 🧠 Quick Memory Method

**Ask yourself 3 questions:**

1. **How much PM authority?**
   - Low = Functional/Weak
   - Moderate = Balanced
   - High = Strong/Projectized

2. **Who does staff report to?**
   - Functional Mgr = Functional/Weak
   - Both = Balanced
   - PM = Strong/Projectized

3. **Is staff full-time?**
   - No = Functional/Weak/Balanced
   - Yes = Strong/Projectized
