## 🎨 Color Game - Memorize!

### Colors by Area:

| Area | Color |
|------|-------|
| Integration | 🟢 Green |
| Scope | 🔵 Blue-Purple |
| Schedule | 🟣 Purple |
| Cost | 🌸 Pink |
| Quality | 🔷 Sky Blue |
| **Resource** | **🟡 Yellow** |
| Communications | 🟠 Orange |
| Risk | 🟤 Brown |
| Procurement | ⚫ Gray |
| Stakeholder | 🔴 Red |

---

## 🎯 Most Repeated

### In All Groups:
**🟢 Integration** (Green)
- Exists in **all** five groups

### In Planning:
**🔵 Scope** (Blue)
- Planning starts with scope

### In Executing:
**🟡 Resource** (Yellow)
- Execution = dealing with people

---

## 📋 Initiating - Only Two

```
1. Develop Project Charter
2. Identify Stakeholders
```

---

## 📝 Planning - Largest

**24 processes** out of 49

### Basic Sequence:

```
1. Plan Project Management
2. Plan Scope → Collect Requirements → Define Scope
3. Create WBS (breakdown)
4. Define Activities → Sequence → Estimate Duration
5. Develop Schedule
6. Estimate Costs → Determine Budget
7. Identify Risks → Analyze → Plan Responses
```

---

## 🔄 WBS is Critical!

**WBS** = Work Breakdown Structure

**Goal**: Break project into smaller parts

**Example**:
```
House
 ├── Design
 ├── Excavation
 ├── Construction
 └── Finishing
```

---

## ⏱️ Duration Estimation

**Depends on number of resources**:

### Example: Excavate Foundations

- 5 workers + 2 excavators = **2 days**
- 2 workers + 1 excavator = **5 days**

**Factors**:
- Number of workers
- Soil type
- Equipment size

---

## 🎲 Risk Strategies (8)

### For Negative Risks:
```
1. Avoid
2. Transfer
3. Mitigate
4. Accept
```

### For Positive Risks:
```
5. Exploit
6. Share
7. Enhance
8. Accept
```

---

## 🔄 Overlap & Iteration

### Ideal:
```
Scope → Schedule → Cost → Risk
```

### Reality:
```
Scope ←→ Cost ←→ Risk ←→ Schedule
```

**May need to go back and modify!**

---

## 💡 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1:
**Budget too high** → Go back to reduce **Scope**

### Scenario 2:
**High risks** → Go back to increase **Budget**

### Scenario 3:
**Time too short** → Go back to add **Resources**

---

## ⏰ Time & Effort

### Quick Processes:
- Project Charter: **1-3 days**
- Create WBS: **2-5 days**

### Long Processes:
- Collect Requirements: **1-2 weeks**
- Develop Schedule: **1-2 weeks**

**Varies by project size**

---

## 🎯 For Exam

### If asked: "What's most repeated?"
- In all groups → **Integration**
- In planning → **Scope**
- In executing → **Resource**

### If asked: "How many processes in Initiating?"
- **Only 2** (Charter + Stakeholders)

### If asked: "Largest process group?"
- **Planning** (24 processes)

## 🔑 Critical Points

1. **49 processes** total
2. **Integration** everywhere
3. **Planning** largest (24)
4. **Initiating** smallest (2)
5. **WBS** = project breakdown
6. **8 strategies** for risks
7. **Overlap** exists - not linear
8. **Resources** affect **duration**

---

## ⚠️ Watch Out!

❌ Sequence is rigid
✅ Has **overlap and going back**

❌ Monitoring is separate phase
✅ Happens **during execution**

❌ Can skip processes
✅ **All necessary**

*Review daily - especially colors and numbers!*
