---

## 🎯 Top 3 Constraints (Iron Triangle)

```
        Scope

## 👥 Critical Terms

### Stakeholder vs Shareholder

| Term | Meaning |
|---------|--------|
| **Stakeholder** | **Project stakeholders** ✓ |
| **Shareholder** | **Shareholder** (stock owner) |

**Relationship**: Shareholder is part of Stakeholder

---

### Definition:

**Stakeholder** = Anyone who affects or is affected by project (positively or negatively)

---

## 🏆 Top 3 Stakeholders

```
1. Project Manager (PM)
2. Sponsor
3. Customer/Client
```

---

## 🔍 Critical Differences

### Customer vs Sponsor

| Element | Customer | Sponsor |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Role** | Project owner | Project funder |
| **Example** | Ministry of Education | International org |
| **Same?** | May be **different** |

---

## 📏 Project Success Definition

### Old (PMBOK 7):
```
✅ Scope
✅ Time
✅ Cost
✅ Quality
```

### New (PMBOK 8 - 2025):
```
✅ Scope
✅ Time
✅ Cost
✅ Quality
✅ Value ← New addition!
```

---

## 💎 Value

**Definition**: Real benefit from project

**Must be**:
- Higher than cost
- Higher than effort
- Linked to strategic objectives

---

## 📋 Stakeholder Examples

### Positive:
- PM
- Sponsor
- Customer
- Team
- End User
- Suppliers

### Negative:
- Competitors
- Government (may affect with regulations)
- Local residents (may oppose)

---

## 🔄 Life Cycle vs Process Groups

### Project Life Cycle:
**Actual time phases**
```
Design → Excavation → Construction → Finishing
```

### Process Groups:
**Administrative processes that repeat**
```
Initiating → Planning → Executing → Monitoring → Closing
```

**Repeat in each phase!**

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ Stakeholder = Shareholder
✅ Stakeholder is **broader**

❌ Monitoring is separate phase
✅ Happens **during execution**

❌ Only 3 constraints
✅ **5 constraints** (+ Quality + Value)

❌ Sponsor = Customer always
✅ May be **different**

---

## 🎯 For Exam

### If asked about project success:
- Complete answer: **Scope + Time + Cost + Quality + Value**

### If asked about Stakeholder:
- **Not** just Shareholder
- **Everyone** who affects or is affected

### If asked about top stakeholders:
- **PM, Sponsor, Customer**

---

## 💡 Quick Tips

1. **Stakeholder** = project stakeholders (official translation)
2. **Value** = new addition in 2025
3. **Monitoring** during execution
4. **Sponsor** may differ from **Customer**
5. Constraints = **5** not 3
