# Week 1 - Session 6: Process Groups and Knowledge Areas

## Overview
This session covers Process Groups and Knowledge Areas in project management, focusing on Project Constraints and Stakeholders.

---

## 📋 What is Project Management?

### Definition:

Project management means dealing with **a set of processes**:
- Not just software or files
- Not just PowerPoint or Word
- Not just software tools

### Administrative Processes:

**Examples of Administrative Processes**:

1. Writing **Project Charter**
2. Preparing **Stakeholder Register**
3. Preparing **Schedule**
4. Writing **project reports**
5. Managing **Changes** (Change Management)
6. Project closure and obtaining approvals

### Administrative Process Requires:

- 🔍 **Research** in files and documents
- 💬 **Communication** with team and stakeholders
- 📞 **Meetings** and interviews
- 📝 **Writing** and documentation
- 🗂️ **Archiving** in databases

**Practical Example**:

When you ask an employee:
- "Write the stakeholder register"

The employee will need:
- 3 days to search previous files
- Review previous projects
- Ask team and senior management
- Communicate with customer
- Search company databases
- All this = **administrative process**

---

## 🔄 Five Process Groups

### 1. Initiating

**When**: At project start or start of each phase
**Goal**: Formally authorize the project
**Example**: Writing Project Charter

---

### 2. Planning

**When**: After initiating
**Goal**: Create detailed project plan
**Examples**:
- Prepare Schedule
- Prepare Stakeholder Register
- Plan resources, costs, quality

---

### 3. Executing

**When**: When actual work begins
**Goal**: Execute project plan
**Examples**:
- Building structures
- Writing code
- Producing products

---

### 4. Monitoring & Controlling

**When**: **During execution** (not a separate phase)
**Goal**: Monitor performance and address deviations
**Examples**:
- Change Management
- Monitor costs and schedule
- Quality control

⚠️ **Important Note**: Monitoring & Controlling is **NOT a separate time phase**, it happens **during execution**

---

### 5. Closing

**When**: At end of project or each phase
**Goal**: Formally close the project
**Examples**:
- Obtain final approvals
- Measure customer satisfaction
- Archive documents
- Release resources

---

## 📊 Ten Knowledge Areas

### Complete List:

1. **Integration Management**
2. **Scope Management**
3. **Schedule Management**
4. **Cost Management**
5. **Quality Management**
6. **Resource Management**
7. **Communications Management**
8. **Risk Management**
9. **Procurement Management**
10. **Stakeholder Management**

**Note**: In PMBOK 8th Edition, new knowledge areas may be added, but **nothing will be removed**.

---

## 🔺 Triple Constraints

### Main Constraints:

```
        Scope
              /\
             /  \
            /    \
           /______\
    Time        Cost
```

### 1. Scope

**Definition**: What will be accomplished in the project
**Constraint**: Cannot go beyond agreed scope
**If scope increases** → cost and time increase

---

### 2. Time/Schedule

**Definition**: Time duration allocated for project completion
**Constraint**: Must adhere to schedule
**If project delays** → penalties and additional costs

---

### 3. Cost

**Definition**: Budget allocated for project
**Constraint**: Must not exceed budget
**If costs increase** → loss and budget failure

---

## 🔷 Fourth Constraint: Quality

### Why is Quality a Constraint?

**Reason**:
- Project can be completed within scope, time, and cost
- **But** if quality is **poor** → project is **failed**

**Example**:
- Build children's hospital in Germany
- Within budget ✅
- On schedule ✅
- Within agreed scope ✅
- **But** no children in the area → **No Value**

---

## 💎 Fifth Constraint: Value

### What is Value?

**Definition**: Real benefit achieved by the project

**New Addition** (PMBOK 8th Edition):
- Project success definition **now** includes **Value**
- Value must be **higher** than:
  - Money spent
  - Effort expended
  - Time consumed

### Link Value to:

- ✅ Project objectives
- ✅ Organization vision
- ✅ Organization strategy
- ✅ Feasibility study

---

## 📏 Definition of Project Success

### Old Definition:

Successful project is one that ended:
1. ✅ Within agreed scope
2. ✅ Within schedule
3. ✅ Within cost
4. ✅ With required quality

### New Definition (PMBOK 8th - 2025):

Same as above + **Value**:
5. ✅ Achieves **real value** for organization and stakeholders

---

## 👥 Stakeholders

### ⚠️ Common Mistake:

**Mistake**: Confusing **Stakeholder** with **Shareholder**

| Term | Meaning | Arabic |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Stakeholder** | Anyone who affects or is affected by project | **المعنيون بالمشروع** / أصحاب المصلحة |
| **Shareholder** | Owner of company shares | **المساهم** |

**Relationship**: 
- **Shareholder** is **part of** **Stakeholders**
- Not every Stakeholder is a Shareholder

---

### Official Definition:

**Stakeholder** = Any person or entity that **affects** or **is affected** by the project, positively or negatively

---

### Examples of Stakeholders:

#### Positive Stakeholders:

1. **Project Manager (PM)** - **Most Important**
2. **Sponsor** - **Most Important**
3. **Customer/Client** - **Most Important**
4. **Senior Management**
5. **Project Team**
6. **End User**
7. **Suppliers/Vendors**
8. **Contractors**

#### Negative Stakeholders:

1. **Competitors** - affected **negatively**
2. **Government Agencies** - may affect with regulations
3. **Local residents** - may oppose project
4. **Environmental groups** - may oppose certain projects

---

### 🎯 Top Three Stakeholders:

```
1. Project Manager (PM)
2. Sponsor
3. Customer/Client
```

---

## 🔍 Difference Between Terms

### Customer vs Sponsor vs Owner:

#### Customer/Client:
- **True owner** of the project
- **Owner** of the project
- Who will use or benefit from the project

**Example**: 
- School building project
- **Customer** = Ministry of Education (project owner)

---

#### Sponsor:
- **Funder** of the project
- Who provides **money**
- May be **same** as customer or **external entity**

**Example 1**: 
- School project
- **Sponsor** = International organization funding project (e.g., UN)
- **Customer** = Ministry of Education (project owner)

**Example 2**:
- Power plant project
- **Customer** = Ministry of Electricity (owner)
- **Sponsor** = International bank providing loan

---

## 🎭 Conflict of Interests

### Why Does Conflict Happen?

**Reason**: Each stakeholder has:
- Different objectives
- Different priorities
- Different interests

### Examples:

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|--------|----------|
| **Customer** | High quality + low price |
| **Contractor** | Higher profit + lower costs |
| **Suppliers** | Sell more at higher price |
| **Contractors** | Fast completion with less complexity |

**Result**: **Conflict** or **clash** may occur between stakeholders

---

## 📑 Project Phases

### What is a Phase?

**Phase** = Major part of project with:
- Specific objective
- Deliverables
- Clear start and end point

---

### Example: House Building Project

#### Main Phases:

```
1. Design
2. Excavation & Foundation
3. Construction
4. Finishing
5. Handover
```

---

### 🔄 Project Life Cycle vs Process Groups

#### Project Life Cycle:

**Actual time phases**:
- Phase 1: Design
- Phase 2: Excavation
- Phase 3: Construction
- Phase 4: Finishing

---

#### Process Groups:

**Administrative processes that repeat**:
- Initiating
- Planning
- Executing
- Monitoring & Controlling
- Closing

**Important Note**: Process groups **repeat** in each phase!

---

### Applied Example:

**Design Phase**:
- ✅ Initiating: Start design phase
- ✅ Planning: Design plan
- ✅ Executing: Draw blueprints
- ✅ Monitoring: Review designs
- ✅ Closing: Approve final designs

**Construction Phase**:
- ✅ Initiating: Start construction phase
- ✅ Planning: Construction plan
- ✅ Executing: Actual building
- ✅ Monitoring: Monitor quality and progress
- ✅ Closing: Accept phase completion

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. ✅ Project Management = **set of administrative processes**
2. ✅ There are **5 process groups**: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, closing
3. ✅ There are **10 knowledge areas** (may increase in 8th edition)
4. ✅ Project constraints: **Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, Value**
5. ✅ **Stakeholder** ≠ **Shareholder**
6. ✅ Stakeholder = **project stakeholders** (official translation)
7. ✅ Top 3 stakeholders: **PM, Sponsor, Customer**
8. ✅ **Sponsor** = funder (may be different from customer)
9. ✅ Project success now includes **Value**
10. ✅ **Monitoring & Controlling** happens **during execution** (not separate phase)
11. ✅ Process groups **repeat** in each **phase** of the project
12. ✅ **Conflict of interests** may occur between different stakeholders

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes - Avoid!

❌ **Wrong**: Stakeholder = Shareholder
✅ **Right**: Stakeholder is broader, Shareholder is part of it

❌ **Wrong**: Monitoring & Controlling is separate phase
✅ **Right**: Happens **during** execution

❌ **Wrong**: Only three constraints (Scope, Time, Cost)
✅ **Right**: 5 constraints (+ Quality + Value)

❌ **Wrong**: Sponsor = Customer always
✅ **Right**: They may be **different**

❌ **Wrong**: Project success = completion on time and budget
✅ **Right**: + Quality + **Value**
