read the transcript and make the corresponding .md for summerization wx-y-ar.md abd wx-y-en.md


for wx-y I want you to generate  memory card
it is wx-y-memory-ar.md and wx-y-memory-en.md

here you put the information that i need to memorize by heart for the exam

keep the memory short and good 
keep the transcript summary nice and explanatory

For key words for arabic keep the english word inbetween `()` so I can link the english word to the arabic one easily

use the same files name by repacing x and y with corresponding week number and video number
